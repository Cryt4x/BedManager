# BedManager
A Minecraft plugin which gives you the possibility to set a minimum number of players, who have to be in bed to set day

This plugin is for an old problem, what I guess everybody had at some point, when you played on a server with your friends.
For example, you are mining, but your friend wants to sleep, because there are zombies in front of his or her home.
With this plugin your friends can go to bed and if there are a minimum number of players in bed, the server will cut the night.

You will be able to change this number in percentages. Like "At least 30% of all online players have to be in bed."

This plugin also adds a few commands for admins:
